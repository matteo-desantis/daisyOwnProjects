PATCH.INIT():    
    dspLib:
        ☐ Oscillator init with other waveforms, see `LFO.cpp`
        ✔ LFO should be refactored from array based to oscillator based on phase calculation per sample (no memory). @done(25-11-23 18:13) Renamed to Oscillator

        ✔ Template parameter for buffer size to be defined in a common header file. @done(25-12-11 01:36)
        ✔ RingBuffer.hpp, RingBuffer.tpp: updated to use templates with static array instead of dynamic allocation. Reduced to one single constructor. Removed .cpp and moved template implementation to .tpp file. @done(25-11-20 00:29)
        ✔ LFO.hpp, LFO.tpp: updated to use templates with static array instead of dynamic allocation. Reduced to one single constructor. Removed .cpp and moved template implementation to .tpp file. @done(25-11-20 00:29)
        ✔ DelayLine.hpp, DelayLine.tpp: updated to use templates with static array instead of dynamic allocation. Reduced to one single constructor. Removed .cpp and moved template implementation to .tpp file. @done(25-11-22 00:29)
        ✔ AllPass.hpp, AllPass.tpp: updated to use templates with static array instead of dynamic allocation. Reduced to one single constructor. Removed .cpp and moved template implementation to .tpp file. @done(25-11-22 00:29)

        - RingBuffer: could add read/write buffer function, and refactor where used. 

        ✔ Changed from double precision to single precision floats @done(25-11-24 00:45)

        ✔ Init buffers in SDRAM region (arena method?). See SDRAM_instructions.md, and RingBuffer.hpp @done(25-12-11 01:37)
            



    OwnProjects/_projLib/ReverbZ:
        ✔ Refactored to template with static arrays for buffer sizes. @done(25-11-23 03:01)
        ✔ Change from double precision to single precision floats @done(25-11-24 00:45)
        ReverbZv2:
            - Diffusion (or other control) controls delay times also -> might need to adjust global buffer length if delay times grow.
            - Mix law should be dB based or power based.
            - Decay Control and drive to be interdependetent. Also control the full wet output level
            - cotrol for mod depth (and rate maybe?)
            

    OwnProjects/ReverbZpatch:
        - Add sampling rate to dspConfig.hpp? would require some refactor in ReverbZ class to pass it down to internal objects.
        ✔ added dspConfig.hpp file with DSPLIB_MAX_BUFFER_SIZE definition @done(25-11-18 01:48)
